# DilutionExperiment
This GitHub repository holds the R code used for peak picking and WGCNA analysis used during the 'dilution experiment' conducted during the DeepDOM cruise in April/May 2013. These files provide details on (1) the peak picking parameters used in XCMS to convert from mzML files into a set of aligned features, and (2) the options selected for the WGCNA analysis that linked the FT-MS data and the TSQ data.
The raw data and experimental metadata are available from MetaboLights: http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS461
